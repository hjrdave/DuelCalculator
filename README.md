# DuelCalculator.js

I developed this app as a learning project for myself. I wanted to learn react.js so I decided to create something that I and other people would find useful and fun. I based it off of the Cyrus Duel Calculator for mobile and added some other features to it that I thought would be handy. This is just a web app and I hope to eventually convert it to a full fledged desktop and mobile app. I will continue to add features and effects to this as I go. Enjoy!
